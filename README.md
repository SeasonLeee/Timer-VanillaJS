# Minimalist Timer

A timer app inspired by Microsoft's.

I use Windows 10's Alarm and Clock application a lot, 
but it always bugs me when I want to using the same thing in other OS.

Then it hit me, why not build one with the knowledge I know of, and make it web base, 
which means I can open a timer as long as I have browser installed!

That'll be awesome, right? Well, to me, at leastðŸ˜†

So, I start making it.

And I challenge myself to not use the help from framework first.

And boy, did that decision helps me a lot!

With the help of framework, I never realize how much work I don't need to do!

So this leads to my another adventure, to dive deeper into the framework I have used!ðŸ˜Ž

But this thing is not done yet, these are the things need to finish in the future,

Todo:
- [ ] Notify user when the timer is completed.
- [ ] Finishing the onConfirm(), confirm button's funcion
- [ ] Rewite this whole thing in Angular and VueJS

Words to remember...

*To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. -- Friedrich Nietzsche*
